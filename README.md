## True Tastings

True Tastings is a web application that facilitates wine tastings with friends and family. Users will be able 
to create an event and choose three different wines to taste. On the event page, each wine selection will be 
accompanied by a form to record tasting notes and final rankings. After the event forms are submitted, the average
score for each wine will be displayed on the event page. The user can view their tasting notes and rankings from past
events in their user profile. 

The idea for this application came from the desire to connect with family and friends through activities we enjoyed 
prior to the COVID pandemic. Wine tasting is an activity normally done in person with worksheets and printed out 
information about the selected wine. True Tastings provides a streamlined way for users to reference wine descriptions 
and share their tasting notes with other participants.
